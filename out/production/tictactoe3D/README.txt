Welcome to a text based TicTacToe! In 3 dimensions!


The rules are as follows:


The board is three dimensional (3 by 3 by 3) and contains 3 different colors of pieces
(red, black, and white).

The first player to get three in a row along any run, including diagonals, wins the game.

Unlike normal tic tac toe, in this game pieces are "pushed" as opposed to "placed".

A move can involve "pushing" a piece reachable from the outside (all except the middle piece), or
placing a piece is the selected spot is empty.



How to play:


At any point, type 'q' to quit, or 'u' to undo the last move.

First select the mode (1, 2, or 3 players). Play then cycles between the players until one player
wins, or no more moves are possible.


A valid move is of the form [pos pos pos direction]

Where pos is one of:
    0
    1
    2

Direction is one of(any case):
    UP
    DOWN / D
    LEFT / L
    RIGHT / R
    FRONT / F
    BACK / B

On a given players turn, type in all five of these parameters in the correct order, then hit enter
to submit the move. A move must also be possible. You can't choose a position on the bottom of the
board, and try to push "down". You can also not make a move which would push one piece out of the
board. Lastly you cannot make a move from the center(1,1,1) of the board, all moves must start on
the outer reachable portion.




Modes:

1 player:

Play against the computer(white) as red, you can go first or second. Black balls will be filled in
at random and are neutral.

2 player:

Play against a friend. Black balls will be filled in at random and are neutral.

3 player:

Play against two other people, the board will start empty.




ENJOY!
