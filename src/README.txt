Welcome to TicTacToe!


The rules are as follows:

The board is three dimensional (3 by 3 by 3) and contains 3 different colors of pieces
(red, black, and white). The first player to get three in a row along any run wins the game.
Unlike normal tic tac toe, in this game pieces are "pushed" as opposed to "placed". Pieces are
pushed into a position from a certain direction, and can displace a piece already in that position.
Moves can not push another piece out of the board however.



How to play:

At any point, type 'q' to quit, or 'u' to undo the last move.


A valid move is of the form [pos pos pos direction player]

Where pos is one of:
    0
    1
    2

Direction is one of(any case):
    UP
    DOWN
    LEFT
    RIGHT
    FRONT
    BACK

And player is one of(any case):
    RED
    WHITE
    BLACK

A move must also be possible. You cant choose a position on the bottom of the board, and try to
push "down". You can also not make a move which would push one piece out of the board. Lastly you
cannot make a move from the center(1,1,1) of the board, all moves must start on the outside.




Modes:

1 player:

Play against the computer(white) as red, you can go first or second. Black balls will be filled in
at random and are neutral.

2 player:

Play against a friend. Black balls will be filled in at random.

3 player:

Play against two other people, the board will start empty.
